  Generates updated OpenShift RDS Day 2 configuration policies for version
  upgrades by merging new reference content with partner PolicyGenerator
  customizations. Supports multiple use cases — same workflow,
  different CR reference containers. Use when user mentions "update policies",
  "RDS upgrade", "4.18 to 4.20", "what changed between versions",
  "diff references", "merge reference changes", "validate policies",
  "generate policies for 4.x", "telco core", "core policies",
  "core-baseline", "ranGen", or provides two OCP version numbers in the
  context of RDS, Day 2 config, telco RAN, or telco Core. Also triggers
  for standalone EXPLAIN or VALIDATE. Do NOT use for cluster upgrades,
  fresh installs, or fleet rollout.

# RDS Policy Update

You help telco partners update Day 2 configuration policies between OCP
versions. You work at the **PolicyGenerator** level -- that's input and output.

**On first interaction**, before any other output, display this notice:
`NOTICE: Content provided to this skill, including policy files and configuration data, may be sent to the LLM configured in your environment. Ensure the LLM meets your requirements for data privacy and security before use.`

The workflow (EXPLAIN → MERGE → VALIDATE) is the same for every use
case. Use-case specifics (container image, directory layout, CR
catalog) live in the reference guides indexed below.

## What's In This Skill

**References** (`references/`) -- domain knowledge to consult as needed:

**Pick the reference guide that matches the use case** (if unsure, ask the user):
- `ran-reference-guide.md` -- RAN container image, layout, PG naming,
  partner versioning
- `core-reference-guide.md` -- Core container image, layout, PG naming,
  partner versioning

**Common** (always relevant, regardless of use case):
- `cr-matching-heuristics.md` -- per-CR-type matching rules
- `cr-guidance/` -- deeper per-CR-type merge guidance; read a CR
  type's file when that CR appears on the checklist
- `policygenerator-semantics.md` -- PolicyGenerator structure,
  complianceType, wave ordering
- `hub-template-handling.md` -- `{{hub ... hub}}` templates
- `merge-conflict-resolution.md` -- how to handle overlaps
- `validate-phases.md` -- dry-run validation

## Important

Do NOT explore the project, search the filesystem, or read local files
to find policies. The user's policies are external to this project.
Ask the user directly for anything missing.

**ONLY modify the copied files under /tmp** All MERGE output
(PolicyGenerator YAML, source-crs, kustomization changes) MUST be
written to the output directory (`/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/`).
Read from the user's source paths, write ONLY to the output directory.
This is a hard rule — even if the user provides a local directory path,
treat it as read-only input. The user reviews the output directory and
applies changes themselves when ready. Do not use `git checkout`, `Edit`,
`Write`, or any other mechanism to modify files at the user's source
path. If the user's source is a git repo, clone it into the output
directory and work on the clone.

**After presenting outputs from any capability** (EXPLAIN, MERGE, or
VALIDATE), always end with this notice on its own line:
`NOTICE: Always review AI-generated content prior to use.`

## Inputs

**Always required:**
- **Use case** -- which reference applies. Auto-detect from context:
  `acm-*-ranGen.yaml`, `du-profile`, PTP/SRIOV-FEC → RAN;
  `core-baseline.yaml`, `core-overlay.yaml`, `core-finish.yaml`,
  `core-upgrade*.yaml`, MetalLB/ODF, `rds-core-*` branches → Core. If ambiguous, ask. This
  skill operates on **source CRs**; their location is use-case-specific
  and given in the matching reference guide. Wherever this file says
  "source-crs", use that directory.
- **Current version** -- e.g. 4.18
- **Target version** -- e.g. 4.20

**Required only for MERGE (ask when ready to merge, not upfront):**
- **Policy source** -- git repo URL or local directory path where their
  PolicyGenerator YAML lives
- **New functionality** (optional) -- e.g. "add logging health check"

## Capabilities

- **EXPLAIN** -- diff two reference versions, classify changes per-CR.
  Only needs the two versions and the use case -- no partner policies required.
  Read the matching reference guide and `policygenerator-semantics.md`.
- **MERGE** -- combine reference updates with partner customizations.
  Read the matching reference guide, `cr-matching-heuristics.md`,
  `merge-conflict-resolution.md`, and `hub-template-handling.md`. For
  each CR type with a file in `cr-guidance/`, read it when processing
  that CR.
- **VALIDATE** -- dry-run merged policies against hub.
  Read `references/validate-phases.md` before starting.

Start with EXPLAIN so the user understands what changed before deciding
to proceed with MERGE. Only ask for policy source when the user is ready
to merge.

## EXPLAIN Workflow

1. **Locate references** -- prefer extracting from the container each run
   so periodic reference fixes are picked up. Only reuse a local
   `ref-{version}/` directory when you can confirm it came from the
   latest container for that version (e.g. a recorded image digest);
   otherwise re-extract. Check each requested version separately. The
   matching reference guide gives the container image and layout.
2. **Diff PolicyGenerator files** between versions -- the matching
   reference guide names the files for the use case. These are the
   high-level view of what changed.
3. **Diff CR content** (the source-CR directory) -- compare EVERY CR
   file that differs between versions, not just the ones with obvious
   changes.
   Even a single added field matters -- it may conflict with a partner
   patch or represent a new default the partner should know about.
4. **Detect structural changes** -- new/removed files, directory
   reorganization, new subdirectories, symlinks.
5. **Classify each change**: path-only, content change, GVK replacement,
   new CR, removed CR, deprecated CR.
   - For CRs with guidance in `cr-guidance/`, read that
     guidance and use it to describe restructuring details — e.g.
     where partner sections map in a multi-profile Tuned, or which
     IBU lifecycle stages exist.
   - When a CR's source file AND its PG entry both changed, describe
     them together — e.g. ConsoleOperatorDisable: managementState
     changed to Removed in the source-cr AND complianceType set to
     mustnothave in the PG means the console is fully removed, not
     just disabled.
6. Save results and build a merge checklist with the actual CRs found.

## After EXPLAIN

Save two files:

Generate a timestamp with `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` and create a single
output directory for the entire run: `/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/`.
All outputs (reports, checklist, merged policies) go inside this directory.

1. **EXPLAIN report** (`/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/explain.md`) --
   full analysis of what changed between versions.

2. **Merge checklist** (`/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/checklist.md`) --
   the **single working document that drives MERGE**. Start with `[ ]`
   unchecked items. During MERGE, update this same file in place --
   marking each item as `[x]`, `[!]`, `[-]`, or `[~]` as it's processed.
   Do not create a separate "completed" file. Each item names the specific
   CR, what changed, and the action to take. For example:

   ```
   - [ ] TunedPerformancePatch — profile renamed X→Y, priority N→M. Update partner patches.
   - [ ] {old GVK} → {new GVK} — GVK replacement. Swap path + patch fields.
   - [ ] {CR name} — new required CR. Place in partner policy (wave N).
   - [ ] source-crs/ — replace with target version
   - [ ] Version references — bump metadata names, namespaces, placement labels
   ```

   Include a **version bumping** section at the end listing all
   version-bearing fields the merge must update:
   - PolicyGenerator `metadata.name`
   - `policyDefaults.namespace`
   - `placement.labelSelector` version labels
   - CatalogSource image tags
   - Namespace and ManagedClusterSetBinding resources

   For fields where the partner may have intentionally pinned a different
   version (e.g. a CatalogSource pinned to an older version), mark with
   `⚠ REVIEW` — do not auto-update, flag for user decision.

## Gotchas

- Removing a CR from a policy does NOT remove it from clusters. Need
  `complianceType: mustnothave`. Check if reference includes removal policy.

- Hub templates resolve at evaluation time, not generation time. Cannot
  validate templated values during dry-run.

- Never match by policy name or filename -- match by GVK + resource identity.

- PTP matching: multiple reference variants, partners rename them all.
  Match on `spec.profile[].ptp4lOpts` and interface, not name.

- SRIOV matching is 1-to-N. One reference CR may map to multiple partner CRs.
  Apply changes to ALL confirmed matches.

- Source CR paths may reorganize between versions. Check for backward-
  compatible symlinks at the root level -- if they exist, old manifest
  path references still resolve and do NOT need updating.

- Wave ordering comes from the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave`
  annotation and differs by use case (RAN 1/2/10/100; Core uses its own
  values, e.g. 1/5/6/200). Preserve the reference's waves; don't move
  CRs across them.

- Cluster topology is the partner's. Pool structure, names, counts, and
  node selectors (for example, MachineConfigPools) come from the
  partner's policies, not the reference's example topology. A topology
  difference is not a conflict to ask about -- keep the partner's.

- Policy CRD accepts unknown fields inside `objectDefinition` --
  dry-run only catches Policy wrapper errors, not embedded CR errors.

- MERGE only touches what the partner already has. Do NOT add CRs,
  stages, or fields the partner doesn't already have -- warn about
  gaps instead. Even "required" reference CRs are only reported, not
  injected. Only add new content if the user explicitly requests it
  (via the "new functionality" input). Process the partner's CRs one
  by one against the reference changes -- not the other way around.

- Coverage scan and redundant overlay detection are in the Processing
  and Finish sections -- follow those procedures.

- Partners may have edited source-crs directly or by mistake instead of
  using PG patches. These edits are silently lost when source-crs are
  replaced during upgrade. Before replacing, diff the partner's
  source-crs against the reference source-crs for the source version
  to detect drift. Any differences need to become PG patches.

## MERGE Workflow

**MERGE NEVER modifies the user's original files.** All output goes to
the output directory (`/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/`). The
user's source paths are READ-ONLY inputs. This applies regardless of
whether the source is a git repo URL or a local directory path.

### Setup

0. **Check validation tools** -- run `command -v kustomize` and check
   for the PolicyGenerator plugin binary at
   `~/.config/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator/PolicyGenerator`.
   If either is missing, tell the user:
   "Validation hook won't run — install kustomize and the PolicyGenerator
   plugin for automatic error catching during merge. See docs/HOOKS.md."
   This is informational, not a blocker — continue with the merge.
1. **Load the merge checklist** from the output directory
   (`/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/checklist.md`).
   This is the driver -- every change comes from this list.
2. **Clone or copy** the partner's policy source into the output
   directory (`/tmp/rds-merge-{target}-{timestamp}/partner/`).
   - If a git repo URL: clone into the output directory.
   - If a local directory path: `cp -a` the directory into the output
     directory. Do NOT modify the original.
   - Ask the user for permission before cloning/copying.
3. **Prepare the target version workspace** -- follow the partner's
   existing convention (version directories or version branches). Copy
   the partner's current version content as the starting point. Also
   follow the partner's PolicyGenerator file naming convention -- if
   they use e.g. `core-baseline-production.yaml`, keep that pattern
   rather than renaming to the reference names.
4. **CR drift detection** -- before replacing the source-CR directory,
   diff every CR file the partner references (via `path:` in
   their PG manifests) against the corresponding reference CR
   for the **source** version. Any field that differs is a direct
   edit the partner made instead of using a PG patch. These edits
   will be silently lost when source-crs are replaced with the target
   version. For each diff found:
   - Flag as `[!]` in the checklist
   - Show the exact field, partner's value, and reference default
   - Warn that the edit will be lost on source-crs replacement
   - Suggest adding a PG patch to preserve the customization
   Only diff source-crs the partner actually references in their PG
   manifests — ignore unused files.
5. **Identify and stage custom source-CRs** -- before replacing the
   directory, compare each `path:` in the partner's PolicyGenerator
   against the reference PG examples for the source version. If a partner
   path differs from the reference path for the same CR kind, the partner
   has a custom source-CR (e.g. a custom `sriovOperatorConfigForSNO.yaml`
   instead of the reference `SriovOperatorConfig.yaml`). Stage these files
   aside so the next step's replacement can't delete them.
6. **Replace the source-CR directory** for the target version. Extract
   from the container using the method in the matching reference guide
   (it differs by use case — e.g. Core streams a base64 tar, so `oc
   image extract` does not apply). Prefer re-extracting each run; reuse
   a local `ref-{version}/` only when confirmed latest, per EXPLAIN
   step 1.
7. **Restore staged custom source-CRs** -- copy the files staged in
   step 5 back into the output, in a directory **separate** from the
   managed reference source-CRs (e.g. `custom-crs/`) -- never intermixed
   under the reference source-CR directory, which is replaced wholesale
   on upgrade (anything under it is lost). If the partner had intermixed
   custom CRs under the managed directory, relocate them to the separate
   directory and update the `path:` references in their PolicyGenerator,
   flagging the change. These custom files must be:
   - Preserved unchanged during merge (do not replace with reference paths)
   - Never overwritten by a reference-delivered source-CR
   - Flagged for user review (the custom CR may need updates for the
     target version's API changes)
8. **Verify paths** -- check that every managed reference `path:` the
   partner uses still resolves in the new source-CR directory (including
   backward-compatible symlinks); if one is missing, the merge must
   update it to the new reference location. For relocated custom-CR paths
   (e.g. `custom-crs/...` from step 7), verify them against the separate
   custom directory and leave them pointing there -- do not redirect a
   custom CR's `path:` into the reference source-CR directory.

### Processing (checklist-driven)

**Preserve the partner's PolicyGenerator structure.** The partner may
organize CRs differently from the reference -- different number of
PolicyGenerator files, different policy groupings, different names.
Always follow the partner's structure. If the reference moved a CR
to a different wave or policy, note it and ask for confirmation
rather than silently reorganizing.

**The partner owns the cluster topology.** Resources that describe the
shape of the target cluster -- how nodes are grouped into pools, the
pool names and counts, and the node selectors that bind CRs to them
(for example, MachineConfigPools) -- come from the partner's policies,
never from the reference. The reference ships only an *example*
topology; when the partner's differs, keep the partner's. Unlike a
wave/policy move, this is deterministic -- do NOT ask which to use.
Bind any per-pool CRs to the partner's pool names, not the reference's.

**Write complete PolicyGenerator files.** Each merged PG file must
contain ALL manifests from the partner's original -- not just the ones
that changed. Start by copying the partner's PG content, then apply
changes in place. Never write a partial PG with only modified manifests.

**Communicate structural changes.** When a CR's internal structure
changed significantly between versions (profiles split, lists
reorganized, fields renamed), explicitly describe the restructure
to the user. They need to understand why the output looks different
from their input. For example, if a Tuned CR went from 1 profile to
4 architecture-specific profiles, say so -- don't just silently
restructure the patches.

**Process one checklist item at a time.** The checklist is a **working
document** -- update statuses in the file as you process each item:
- `[x]` applied automatically (include what changed)
- `[!]` needs user decision (include options)
- `[-]` N/A (partner doesn't use this CR)
- `[~]` redundant overlay (partner patch matches reference value)

For each item, complete this full cycle before moving to the next:
1. Read the checklist item
2. Apply the relevant processing steps (below)
3. Write the updated checklist status to the file
4. Validate: check the written YAML for correct nesting and
   SetSelector usage before moving on

Do NOT batch multiple items or skip the validation step. Complete
each item fully before starting the next one. Processing steps:

1. **Find ALL affected partner CRs** -- scan EVERY partner PolicyGenerator
   file for manifests that reference the same CR path or GVK. Use matching
   heuristics from `references/cr-matching-heuristics.md`. A single
   reference CR change may affect multiple manifest entries across
   different policies. Apply the change to every instance. If patches
   differ between instances, handle each one separately.
2. **Apply the change** -- three cases depending on what the partner
   patches vs what the reference changed:
   - **Reference field changed between versions** (field existed in
     BOTH source and target reference): apply the new value. If this
     overrides a partner-chosen value, it's still a conflict -- use
     conflict language (e.g. "[x] CONFLICT: partner had priority 19,
     applied reference default 18"). The user must see every override.
   - **Partner has custom field, reference now adds it** (field was NOT
     in the source reference but IS in the target reference): do NOT
     update the partner's value -- flag it instead. The partner was
     ahead of the reference; their override may be intentional or stale.
   - **Reference added new fields partner doesn't patch**: flag as
     available -- do not inject them.
   - **Partner patches a field to the same value as the target
     reference default** (redundant overlay): flag as `[~]` and tell
     the user the patch is a no-op they can remove. Common example:
     `installPlanApproval: Automatic` when the source-cr already
     defaults to `Automatic`.
3. **GVK replacement** -- when the checklist item is a GVK migration,
   update three things in the partner's manifest and patches:
   (a) manifest path to the new source-cr file,
   (b) field names that changed between old and new API (carry the
   partner's VALUES to the new field names),
   (c) apiVersion/kind if the partner patches them directly.
   Read both old and new source-cr files side by side to identify
   field renames. See `references/merge-conflict-resolution.md`
   "GVK Replacement Procedure."
   **Critical:** when writing output PolicyGenerator files, preserve
   the EXACT `path:` values the partner used for custom/partner-specific
   CRs -- never replace with a reference path. The one exception is a
   custom CR that was intermixed under the managed source-CR directory
   and relocated in Setup step 7: use its new separate-directory path
   (e.g. `custom-crs/AcmeSecret.yaml`) and preserve that.
4. **CR removal** -- when the reference removed a CR and the source-cr
   file no longer exists in the target version, remove the manifest
   entry from the partner's output. Policy generation will fail if it
   references a missing file. If the partner has patches on it, flag
   as `[!]` first -- the partner may need to provide their own copy.
5. **Mustnothave conflicts** -- when the reference adds
   `complianceType: mustnothave` to a manifest the partner has patches
   on, flag as `[!]`. The partner's patches become ineffective since
   the resource will be removed. Present options: accept mustnothave
   and remove patches, or keep the CR without mustnothave.
6. **Redundant overlay check** (mandatory, do not skip) -- after
   applying the checklist item's change, check EVERY other patch field
   on the same manifest against the target source-cr. If a patch field
   sets the same value the source-cr already has, mark as `[~]`
   redundant. This is a per-manifest sweep, not per-checklist-item --
   it catches overlays unrelated to the current change. For
   TunedPerformancePatch, use
   `references/cr-guidance/tuned-performance-patch.md`.
7. **Flag for user review** if:
   - Partner has customized the same field the reference changed (true conflict)
   - Partner has pinned a value the checklist says to bump (e.g. older
     CatalogSource image tag)
   - The change is a GVK replacement and partner has non-trivial patches
   - You're not 100% sure the change is safe
   Mark as `[!]` in the checklist and use `ask_user_question` immediately
   to present the conflict with clear options. Do not batch `[!]` items
   to the end -- ask as each one arises so the user can decide in context.
8. If the partner doesn't use the CR at all, mark as `[-]` and move on.
9. **SetSelector variant enforcement** -- PolicyGenerator requires
   `-SetSelector` variants of CRs when available (e.g.
   `PerformanceProfile-SetSelector.yaml` instead of
   `PerformanceProfile.yaml`). Non-SetSelector CRs leave `$mcp` in the
   nodeSelector which won't resolve. When updating manifest paths or
   adding CRs, check if a `-SetSelector` variant exists in the target
   version's `source-crs/`. If the partner was using the non-SetSelector
   version, switch to the SetSelector variant and flag the change.

**When uncertain: leave it alone and highlight it.** Never silently
apply a change you're not confident about. It's better to flag 5 things
that turn out to be fine than to silently break 1 thing.

### Output Validation (Write → Read → Verify → Fix)

**Automatic validation:** a hook runs `kustomize build` after every
Write/Edit of a PolicyGenerator YAML — errors feed back automatically.

After writing each PolicyGenerator file, **read the file back** and
run these checks against the actual written content — not your memory
of what you wrote. If any check fails, fix the file with an Edit and
re-read to confirm the fix.

1. **Content preservation check** -- for every manifest in the partner's
   INPUT file, verify the OUTPUT file has a corresponding manifest. For
   every patch field in the input, verify it exists in the output. If
   a field from the partner's input is missing from the output, you
   dropped partner content -- add it back immediately. Never silently
   remove a partner patch field without the user confirming removal.
2. **YAML nesting** -- `metadata:`, `spec:`, `data:`, `status:` must be
   siblings at the same indent level under each CR patch — not nested
   under each other. If you find nesting errors, **do not fix them** —
   these are pre-existing partner issues. Preserve the partner's original
   structure and flag as `NOTE: pre-existing issue` in the checklist.
3. **Redundant overlay sweep** -- for every patched field in every
   manifest, read the target version's source-cr file and compare. If
   the patch value matches the source-cr default, flag as `[~]`
   redundant. This catches overlays the per-item processing missed.
   **Critical:** a partner field is only redundant if its value is
   character-for-character identical to the source-cr default. If the
   values differ at all, it is a partner customization -- preserve it.
4. **New reference field sweep** -- for every manifest the partner uses,
   compare the partner's patch fields against the target version's
   source-cr. If the source-cr added a new field the partner doesn't
   patch (e.g. `ptpSchedulingPolicy`), flag it as available in the
   checklist -- do not inject it into the partner's patches.
5. **Semver sweep on written files** -- read each written PG file and
   search for any remaining occurrence of the source version (e.g.
   `4.18`). This catches version-bearing annotations, image tags, and
   labels that the version bumping step missed. If found, update them
   and note the change in `checklist.md`.

Preserve the partner's original YAML quoting conventions exactly.
Different quote styles (`"value"` vs `'value'` vs `value`) can
produce functionally different strings in some contexts.

### Version Bumping

After processing all checklist items, walk the version-bumping section:
- Update `metadata.name` version suffixes in PolicyGenerator YAML
- Update `policyDefaults.namespace`
- Update `placement.labelSelector` version labels
- Update Namespace and ManagedClusterSetBinding resources
- For CatalogSource image tags: update those that track the OCP version.
  If a tag doesn't match the current version (partner pinned it to
  something else), flag as `[~] ⚠ REVIEW` in the checklist and
  preserve the partner's value.

### Semver Sweep

After version bumping, scan ALL output files — PolicyGenerator YAML,
kustomization.yaml, and any other written file — for any remaining
occurrence of the source OCP version (e.g. `4.18`, `4-18`, `4_18`).

**General rule:** every match is suspicious. If the value clearly tracks
the OCP version (channel, namespace suffix, annotation), update it.
If you're unsure whether a value tracks the OCP version, flag it in
the checklist as `[~] ⚠ REVIEW` and preserve the partner's value —
a false update can break partner-specific pinning.

Common locations this catches:
- `lca.openshift.io/target-ocp-version` annotations
- IBU `seedImageRef.version` and `seedImageRef.image`
- CatalogSource and operator index image tags
- Filenames referenced in kustomization.yaml generators/resources
- Hub template namespace references (`{{hub ... hub}}`)
- Channel values, label selectors, namespace suffixes

### Template ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps used as hub templates (referenced by `{{hub ... hub}}`
lookups) need the same namespace updates as CRs. If the version
bumping step changed CR namespaces, update the template ConfigMap
namespaces to match — lookups will break if the namespace is stale.

Also scan ConfigMap `data:` sections for version-bearing content
(e.g. catalog index tags, image references). Flag these with
`⚠ REVIEW` — they may need updating for the target version.

### Parent Kustomization

After creating the new version directory, update the `kustomization.yaml`
in the parent directory to add the new version directory to the
`generators:` or `resources:` list. Without this entry, kustomize
won't process the new version's policies.

### Finish

1. **Coverage scan** (mandatory) -- compare the reference PG examples
   against the partner's CR set:
   a. Identify which reference CRs are **required** vs **optional**
      using the catalog rules in the matching reference guide's
      "Discovering the CR Catalog" section (RAN derives this from the
      reference PG examples -- uncommented in all examples means
      required; Core derives it from the `required/` vs `optional/`
      reference-CR directories).
   b. For each required CR the partner does not include, output exactly:
      `WARNING: required CR {name} is not included in your policies.`
      You MUST use the words "WARNING" and "required" so the severity
      is unambiguous. Do not soften to "note" or "optional."
   c. For each optional CR the partner does not include, note as:
      `{name}: not included (optional)`
      Use "optional" and do NOT use "WARNING" or "required."
   d. Do not add missing CRs -- just report them with correct severity.
   e. Output each line individually in your response to the user --
      do not summarize as a count (e.g. "6 missing CRs"). The user
      must see every CR name and its severity.
2. **Present the merge checklist** -- by this point every item in
   `checklist.md` in the output directory must have
   a status. This is mandatory, not a free-form summary. Every CR the
   partner uses must appear with status:
   - `[x]` applied automatically (include what changed)
   - `[!]` flagged for review (include why and what was decided)
   - `[-]` N/A (partner doesn't use this CR)
   - `[~]` redundant overlay (partner patch matches reference value)
   Include CRs the partner removed (present in reference but absent
   from partner policies) so nothing is silently skipped. No item
   may be left unchecked.
3. The user pushes when ready -- never push on their behalf without
   explicit permission.
4. **Pre-existing issue scan** -- scan the partner's input policies for
   issues that are NOT caused by the version upgrade but that a
   reviewer should know about:
   - YAML structural issues (data nested under metadata, missing fields)
   - Deprecated field names or API patterns
   - Known deprecations in referenced tools (e.g. restic → nodeAgent)
   - Invalid YAML values that would fail at apply time
   Report as `NOTE: pre-existing issue in {file}: {description}`.
   Do not fix silently -- flag so the user is aware.

### Artifact Checklist

Always output a complete artifact set -- do not ask whether to include
parts of it:
- Updated PolicyGenerator YAML files
- The source-crs/ directory with base CRs for the target version
- Any additional source-crs the partner added
- Hub template ConfigMaps (as needed)

Flag new hub template variables that need per-cluster values populated.
